## Note
Frontend is in Vue 3 and it uses Vite to run. This application is using cookie based authentication and both
frontend and backend should be in same top level domain. If you are running the backend in localhost:8000 so the
frontend should be in localhost:3000.

Please remember that the default backend url is http://localhost:8000, if you are running the backend in a different
url you need to change the url in the src/api/clients.ts file.

### Running the application
1. First you need to install pnpm.
2. Then you need to run the following command to install the dependencies.
```bash
pnpm install
```
3. Then you need to run the following command to start the frontend.
```bash
pnpm dev
```
